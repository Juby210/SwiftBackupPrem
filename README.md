# SwiftBackupPrem
Swift Backup Premium LSPosed module (tested on v4.2.3).

Bypasses google account login requirement to allow user to create cloud backups.

It is highly suggested not to log in into your google account (especially when google drive sync isn't needed) because it can can lead into getting banned by developer via firebase.
