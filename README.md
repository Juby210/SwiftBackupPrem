# SwiftBackupPrem
Swift Backup Premium LSPosed module (tested on v4.2.3).

Allows you to set your own firebase credentials, so only your firebase instance is used.

It is highly recommened to set your own firebase credentials, because the developer can ban you from accessing original app using his firebase instance.
